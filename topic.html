    <h2> The Pioneers of Web 2.0 </h2>
    Altough there isn't a dedicated point in time, or a specific site or content creator that signifies the start of Web 2.0, the transition of several major websites from creater content to user contribution indicate the revolutioin of Web 2.0
    <ol>
        <li> User Centered Design</li>
        <li> Ability for users to contribute to, and edit the site or its content</li>
        <li> Peer to Peer optimisation</li>
    </ol>
    These were some of the major factors that contributed to the success of these revolutionised sites, to the right you can see some of the major sites that were replaced by their 2.0 counterparts, and below you can read some of the major differences that contributed to the end of these websites.

<h3> TL;DR </h3>
As seen above the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0 wasnt as instantanious as a specific product release or, perhaps, a policy or standardisation change, but more an intergration of dynamic and user-generated content pioneered by several ingenuic websites that quickly became leaders of their domains.
